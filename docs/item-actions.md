## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
Using PackingListItem component with EditableListItem for text editing and SwipeableContainer for mobile delete:
```typescript
interface PackingListItemProps {
  item: Item;
  onToggle: (id: string) => void;
  onDelete: (id: string) => void;
  onEdit: (id: string, newName: string) => void;
}
```

### Interaction States
